## Solution:

In this challenge, we need to beat the filters and log in as admin, on inputing `admin` as username and password we get -

And the filter for first round is `Round1: or`.

We can see the sql query in the background, `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='admin'`.

And since it uses `AND` we only need either username or password to be correct and can comment out the password check by inputing the username as `admin' --` and the password as any value.

On the second round the filters are `Round2: or and like = --`, however one of the hints reveals that SQLite is being used as the database, hence we can use other comments which sqlite supports such as `/* */`.

We can enter the username as `admin' /*` and the password as any value again.

On the third round, the filters are `Round3: or and = like > < --`, but we can terminate the query early by using semicolon. This can be done by entering username as `admin';`.

![image4](resources/web-exploitation/image4.png)

Now the filters for round 4 is `Round4: or and = like > < -- admin`. Since the word `admin` is blocked, we need to use concatenating operator to reconstruct the word admin using the username `adm'||'in';`.

![image5](resources/web-exploitation/image5.png)

Now the filters for round 5 is `Round5: or and = like > < -- union admin`. Since it doesnt include the concatenation operator we can again use the username `adm'||'in';`.

![image6](resources/web-exploitation/image6.png)

On checking filter.php we get

```
<?php
session_start();

if (!isset($_SESSION["round"])) {
    $_SESSION["round"] = 1;
}
$round = $_SESSION["round"];
$filter = array("");
$view = ($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] == "/filter.php");

if ($round === 1) {
    $filter = array("or");
    if ($view) {
        echo "Round1: ".implode(" ", $filter)."<br/>";
    }
} else if ($round === 2) {
    $filter = array("or", "and", "like", "=", "--");
    if ($view) {
        echo "Round2: ".implode(" ", $filter)."<br/>";
    }
} else if ($round === 3) {
    $filter = array(" ", "or", "and", "=", "like", ">", "<", "--");
    // $filter = array("or", "and", "=", "like", "union", "select", "insert", "delete", "if", "else", "true", "false", "admin");
    if ($view) {
        echo "Round3: ".implode(" ", $filter)."<br/>";
    }
} else if ($round === 4) {
    $filter = array(" ", "or", "and", "=", "like", ">", "<", "--", "admin");
    // $filter = array(" ", "/**/", "--", "or", "and", "=", "like", "union", "select", "insert", "delete", "if", "else", "true", "false", "admin");
    if ($view) {
        echo "Round4: ".implode(" ", $filter)."<br/>";
    }
} else if ($round === 5) {
    $filter = array(" ", "or", "and", "=", "like", ">", "<", "--", "union", "admin");
    // $filter = array("0", "unhex", "char", "/*", "*/", "--", "or", "and", "=", "like", "union", "select", "insert", "delete", "if", "else", "true", "false", "admin");
    if ($view) {
        echo "Round5: ".implode(" ", $filter)."<br/>";
    }
} else if ($round >= 6) {
    if ($view) {
        highlight_file("filter.php");
    }
} else {
    $_SESSION["round"] = 1;
}

// picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
?>
```

Thus the flag is `picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}`


## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- `--` is a common SQL comment.
- SQLite also uses `/* */` as comments.
- We can terminate statements early in SQLite using `;`.
- SQLite has concatenating operator `||`.

## Notes:

- ITried setting value of cookies as admin but that didnt work.
